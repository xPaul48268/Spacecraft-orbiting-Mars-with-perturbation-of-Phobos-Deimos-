# Project Title

Spacecraft orbiting Mars with perturbation of Phobos & Deimos

## Description

I made a quick simulation with tudat-space-dev of an spacecraft orbiting Mars that experienced pertubation effects of Phobos & Deimos the two Martian Moons.
You also have the output of the intinial and end cartesian elements and a simulation visualizing the orbits path.
